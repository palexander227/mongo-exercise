# Mongo Exercise Tracking 

This app is intended to be a workout tracker. I was provided fairly complete front end code. What this app shows is the entire app fully functional with Express back end, Mongo database and Mongoose schema. 

## Description

If I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts, I need to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I also need to be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled; if the exercise is resistance training, I want to track the total pounds used duing the workout. 

This particular version of the app only allows for resistance and cardio exercises.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress. (More to add here)

## Disclaimer 

This project is still under construction. A more complete description and documentation of the final project is still in progress.
